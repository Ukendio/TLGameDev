# CsvReader.cs

## Introduction

In your games and programs, you might want a way to store and edit a lot of data in an simple human-readable format. CSV files are a great way to store large quantities of structured data.

Comma-Separated Values (.csv) files are a ubiquitous plaintext data format for storing tabular data. Applications like Excel and Google Sheets can export spreadsheets to a CSV format. You can also edit CSV files in any plaintext editor.

CSV files are organized into rows of comma-separated values. Each value is deliminated by a comma, and every line in the file represents a new row.

For example, consider the following table:

| Class       | Strength | Dexterity | Constitution | Intelligence | Wisdom | Charisma |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|----------|
| Engineer    | 12       | 12        | 10           | 18           | 8      | 14       |
| Wizard      | 8        | 12        | 8            | 20           | 14     | 8        |
| Guardsman   | 16       | 16        | 16           | 8            | 10     | 12       |
| Faresperson | 16       | 16        | 10           | 8            | 14     | 16       |

This table could be represented as the following CSV file:

```
Class,Strength,Dexterity,Constitution,Intelligence,Wisdom,Charisma
Engineer,12,12,10,18,8,14
Wizard,8,12,8,20,14,8
Guardsman,16,16,16,8,10,12
Faresperson,16,16,10,8,14,16
```
As you can see, CSV files are a great way to store high volumes of structured data in an easy-to-edit and easy-to-read format. Inventory items, enemy stat blocks, and more can be represented in CSV Files.

## CsvReader.cs

While CSV files are in plaintext, parsing them can be a challenge. This is because some data in a CSV file might contain a comma, so special precautions must be taken to ensure that programs reading a CSV file know the difference between a comma that is separating two values and commas that are actually parts of a value. The specification for CSV files is outlined in [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180).

The below code implements a CSV Reader class that can parse CSV files in accordance to RFC 4180.
